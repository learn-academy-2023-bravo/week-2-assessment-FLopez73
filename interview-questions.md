# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer:The parameter is the parenthesis in the structure of a function that takes an argument while the argument is the data that is passed through the function to get a result.

Researched answer: The parameter is just a placeholder for function arguments also utilized as local variables inside of the function to get values from arguments. Once the function is ready to be executed the argument is the data that is passed through the paramater to get the result that the user is wanting to obtain.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: .map() needs to be assigend to a new variable since it returns a new array of the same length of the original. It is required to assing the .map method to a new function.

Researched answer: There a a few paramateres that .map method takes and those are an element, index, array. The callbackFn parameter is the only one that is optional.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: The main difference of the two is that the .map is a method that iterates over all the itmes in the array and yields an array that is the same length. While .filter is a method that is looking for values that match the condition you state and yields an array that match your condition provided that is typically not the same length of the original.

Researched answer: The main difference would be that the .map method alters the original arrray while filter does not. .filter yields a new array but it typically is not the same lenght as the original array while .map also yields a new array stored in a new variable that has modified the original one but is still the same length.

1. What is iteration?

Your answer:Iteration is running a loop going over a set of data once to it's completion or a certain condition is met.

Researched answer: A way to traverse over a list or a collection of data that keeps going until a condition is met.

1. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: A function is a code of block that preforms and action or returns a value while a method is a function as well but it belongs to an object.

Researched answer: Function are different then a method becuase they stnad alone and are not required to be attached to an object. Method require an object name and a dot operator to be called while a function does not.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: I am not sure what hoisting in Javascript is.

Researched answer: Where the decalration for a variable is at the top of the document so that the variable can be called anywhere in the document below. That variable can be assigned any where below the declaration. You are separating the declaration and the assignmet of the variable.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

I used w3schools to look these up.

1. Component: In React the components are complrable to a function in Javascript. There are two types class components and function components.

2. Spread operator: Used in React to copy part or all of an array into another array or object.

3. React state: It is an object that is used to store the property values that belong to a component.

4. React props: It is the argument that is passed through the React component such as the variable in the function for JavaScript.

5. DOM events: These DOM events are the things that a user can do to interact with the webpage or application.
